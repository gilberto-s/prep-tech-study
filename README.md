# Prep Tech Study Repository

This repository contains my exercises, notes, and reviews as I progress through the Prep Tech program.
My goal is to solidify my knowledge in algorithms, data structures and problem-solving while preparing for technical interviews.

## Repository Structure

-   **exercises/**: Here you'll find the coding exercises I solve:

    -   **algorithms/**: Exercises related to different algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching).
    -   **data-structures/**: Exercises focused on data structures (e.g., linked lists, trees).

-   **notes/**: This folder contains my study notes and revision summaries on various topics:

    -   **algorithms.md**: Notes on different algorithms and their complexities.
    -   **data-structures.md**: Detailed notes on data structures like arrays, linked lists, and trees.
    -   **system-design.md**: Key concepts and practices for system design.

## Goals and Progress

This repository serves as a tool for tracking my learning journey.
I will be updating this repository regularly as I make progress in the Prep Tech program.
