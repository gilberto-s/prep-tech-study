# Data Structures

## Linked List

-   A linked list is a linear data structure that represents a sequence of elements (nodes).
-   Each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node.
-   Each node is stored in different places in memory, connected by pointers.
-   The size of a linked list is dynamic, meaning it can grow or shrink as needed.
-   Insertion and deletion of nodes at the beginning of the list are efficient (O(1)), while operations at other positions may require traversing the list (O(n)).
